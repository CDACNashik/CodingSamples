	Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. 

	Node. js is primarily used for 
	non-blocking (asynochronus), 
	event-driven servers (custom events), 
	[onclick,onmouseover]
	due to its single-threaded nature. 
	It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services
	(CRUD - insert , update,select,delete - Single thread)
